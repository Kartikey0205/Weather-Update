# <h1 align="center">Weather Report Projects!</h1>

_**This project is made up of HTML,CSS, JS, nodeJS, expressJS, EJS . It was actually a valid website but due to security purpose I had deleted my API so instead of {Your API Key} enter your Api in the public/js/app.js and it will run perfectly.**_

**_So this web page doesn't give a weather report currently . I had made this just for my learning purpose of how to use a templating engine and the process deployment of webpage!_**
